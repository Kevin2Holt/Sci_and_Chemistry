I helped my wife with some programing she needed to do for her lab-work. Basically just parsing data, doing some calculations, then displaying the result.

I have no idea what any of it is doing or what any of it means, but we ended up with a working program at some point.

As a quick disclaimer, I have no idea what state these programs are in. Some might run, but are doing some calculations wrong (giving incorrect output). Some might not even run, giving some error(s) that I couldn't figure out fast enough, at which point I just rewrote the program in a new file, using the old one as reference on the different functions and maths. There might be one or two that work, and work properly. I'm not sure which one(s) they would be. Not that I would be able to tell the difference at this point even if I did look at them.

Overall, I will say that it was a fun learning experience for me. I got to / had to use some python funcitons & libraries that I hadn't really explored at the time. In the end, I'm convinced that I (as a programmer) wrote better code than her professor (a chemistry research head; my wife being a grad student), though I never was confident that the math was right.
*To illustrate, his code took over an hour to iterate through all of the calculations, whereas my code took about 5 minutes. :)*
